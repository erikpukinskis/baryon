# Explanation

Below is a table listing the first 64 elements (by atomic number) along with an accounting of which elements are used in life, geology, and technology.

### Element Role Symbols

In the columns where we list the uses of elements in life, geology, or technology, we include some symbols indicating which are most critical:

- "\*" appears next to roles in life forms
- "\*\*" appears next to life processes which are absolutely necessary for complex multicellular life
- "+" appears next to common surface geological formations
- "++" appears next to critical components of the earths fundamental geologic process (from mantle to oceanic crust to river beds)
- "!" appears next to common technologies
- "!!" next to technologies which are crucial to a modern, large scale civilization

### Critical Element Emojis

In addition, the elements critical for life/geology/technology are highlighted with emojis next to their names:

🪴 = "\*\*" = critical for complex life
🪨 = "++" = critical geology
🚜 = "!!" = critical technology
